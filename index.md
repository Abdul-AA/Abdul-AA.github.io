# Optimizing the Grid

Collaborated with a team of five on an optimization project utilizing mixed-integer programming to achieve Canada's net-zero emissions in the electricity sector by 2035. Aligned with Canada's commitments to the Paris Agreement, the project addressed the complexity of balancing environmental, economic, and social factors. Utilized a multi-objective mixed-integer programming (MIP) approach and goal programming (GP) approach to explore trade-offs and compromises. The MIP model outlined a roadmap for electricity generation and technology investment, considering cost minimization and reliable energy supply. The GP model assessed the broader feasibility of emissions, energy generation, capacity goals, and capital costs. The project contributes to environmental and energy debates, emphasizing the potential of data modeling for conceptualization in complex problem-solving. The report provides insights into model formulation, implementation, results, implications, potential extensions, and lessons learned in the application of linear optimization in complex and uncertain environments.

### Skills and Tools Used
- Mixed integer programming

# Diabetes Classifier

Diabetes mellitus is a group of diseases that affects how the body regulates and uses glucose. It is characterized by abnormally high levels of glucose in the blood. A hormone known as insulin regulates glucose levels in the blood. It is produced by the islet cells in the pancreasâ€”an impairment in the body's ability to make or respond to insulin results in diabetes. Diabetes is commonly classified into type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. The former, also known as insulin-dependent diabetes, is an autoimmune disease whereby the islet cells are destroyed and unable to produce insulin, while the latter occurs when cells do not produce enough insulin and the body does not respond normally to insulin. Type 2 diabetes, also known as insulin-resistant diabetes, is the commonest type of diabetes. Other types include prediabetes and gestational diabetes. Using machine learning to diagnose diabetes will make the diagnostic process more efficient, which will, in turn, make treatment easier and perhaps more effective.

### Skills and Tools Used
- Exploratory data analysis

# Data Analysis: Comcast Telecom Consumer Complaints

Comcast is the largest American global telecommunication conglomerate. In October 2016, they received a fine of $2.3 million from the Federal Communications Commissions (FCC) after customers filed more than 2000 complaints between April, 2016 and June, 2016. The fine was purportedly the largest civil penalty imposed on a cable operator. The FCC claimed they fined Comcast for wrongfully charging customers, but Comcast refuted this claim. The company's database serves as a repository of public customer complaints filed against Comcast. I will analyze the relevant data to pin down Comcast's customer service flaws, how the organization could improve, and if they received a significant number of billing- related complaints.
