## Comparative Study of Countries
I created a dashboard on Tableau for an insurance company that is expanding and looking to situate new branches in various parts of the world. In the dashboard, I compared multiple metrics such as income, life insurance share, market share, penetration, the ratio of reinsurance accepted, and retention ratio of countries of varying income levels using the sample insurance dataset and world development indicators dataset. I performed the following steps in creating the dashboard:
-	I created a geographic map showing the countries the insurance firm was considering and indicated each country's income level. 
-	I included an income group filter in the dashboard to select countries based on their income level.
-	I included a Wikipedia webpage to show real-time data of each country; the wiki page can be altered by selecting the country of interest on the map.
-	I included two parameters in the dashboard for year selection and category selection. The former can be used to select the year of interest, and the latter can be used to select the metric of interest.
-	I included a KPI table to show the comparison between the selected year and the year before the selected one.
-	I included a growth indicator to display the performance of each income group based on the selected year and selected metric. It shows either positive, negative, or neutral.
-	Finally, I included a trend line that shows the selected category values.

Note that the title of each sheet in the dashboard is dynamic.
